# chamber

## Description
Chamber is a personal project for practicing setting up a social media-esque platform using Node.js, Gulp, React, MongoDB, Semantic-ui and many other technologies.

Currently setting up Passport.js for user authentication, and intend to use WebRTC for file-sharing. I intend to make an online mixer for users to collaborate, but that is down the line.
